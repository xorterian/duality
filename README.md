# duality
What if I say that by reversing the bit-layers of some media like images or sounds, you will get another ones making sense?

S2S-Depth-Rev: Sound to Sound program which reverses the bitstring of all the intenzities of an input sound.

SxS2S-Dualize: (Sound, Sound) to Sound program which mix two sounds into one the way in you can listen to the first one but by reversing it, you will listen to the second one.

S3S-Depth-Rev: Sound to Sound program which makes the trial - this is why the word joke S3S instead of S2S - of the input sound. This triality is not unique as the duality (simply reversing) but you can customize via your own permutation cube-roots of the identity permutation - there are a lot of cube-roots.

SxSxS2S-Trialize: (Sound, Sound, Sound) to Sound program which mix three sounds into one the way in you can listen to the first one but by making its first trial, you can listen to the next sound, and by making its second trial, you can listen to the last sound. In this case the three sounds share the same 16 bit-layers, so it comes only 5 bit-layer to each sound which makes it more noisy.

When you make duals and trials, try to choose sounds with really similar lengths. It must be .wav files, and you should not resave the results of the programmes because your sound editor might confuse the LSBs and it will not work.
